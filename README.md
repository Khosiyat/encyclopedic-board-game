## Game Description

Two players start at the bottom-left corner of a 16x8 board (cell 1). Players take turns answering encyclopedic questions and rolling dice to move forward. The first player to reach cell 128 (top-right) wins!

---

## Game Logic

- Players begin at cell 1.
- On their turn, a player must correctly answer the question on their current cell.
- If correct, they roll a dice (1â€“6) and move forward that many cells.
- The other player judges the answer correctness.
- Turns alternate until one player reaches or exceeds cell 128.
- Movement and dice rolls are animated (Arcade) or interactive (Streamlit).
- Sounds play on dice roll, movement, and winning.
